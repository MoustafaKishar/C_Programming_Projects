# This folder contains the implementation of a Traffic Lights Program with an On-demand Pedistraian Button. 
## Brief Description: 
The system contains two modes, a normal mode, and a pedestrian-passing mode. In normal mode, the traffic lights shift normally for the cars to pass. However, when a pedestrian presses the cross-walk button, the normal mode is interrupted and the pedestrian’s traffic lights are prioritized and the system shifts from the normal to pedestrian-passing mode.
## Development Process:
1. Implemented a flowchart for the system and defined the system’s constraints.
2. Designed a full static architecture for the system including layers, drivers, and APIs.
3. Prepared the system’s development environment on Microchip Studio using ATmega32 and C Programming Language.
4. Wrote the code for the drivers and application while following the SOLID principles.
5. Prepared the testing environment in Proteus Software. 
6. Tested the application using several user stories.
